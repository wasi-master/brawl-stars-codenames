 Codenames for brawlers in brawl stars!

## What?

So Brawl stars is this game made by supercell (the creators of clash of clans, clash royale etc.) and that game has a lot of characters. Now the funny thing is that in the code the characters aren't referenced with their original name but with another name that the devs have for each character, I just like to call them codenames. This is a list of all those characters and a simple script on how I made the list.

**The codenames can be found in [codenames.md](https://github.com/wasi-master/brawl-stars-codenames/blob/main/codenames.md**

## How?

The [characters.csv](https://github.com/wasi-master/brawl-stars-codenames/blob/master/characters.csv) file is datamined from brawl stars code and contains information about all the characters in the game including their codenames. I wrote some code to only get the items we need which is the name and the codename. You can open this file to see all the other information too.
